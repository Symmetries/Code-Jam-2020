# WEB WHITEBOARD - CODE JAM 2020 

1. **Inspiration:** <br/>
We want to make online schooling less challenging for students. With Zoom Whiteboard, OneNote, Notability,.. all the option while writing is either having next page or scrolling down but this creates a problem when a student has not finished copying down. Before, our lecture halls have whiteboards and professors would only erase when they have used all others.

2. **What it does?** <br/>
It will create a two-page whiteboard that allows the user to move forwards but can still keep the previous page. The user has option to choose different pen color and also they can use eraser if they make mistake. 

3. **How we built it?**<br/>
We built it mostly by Javascript. We used HTML, JS, CSS as well as p5.js for 2D graphics

4. **Accomplishments that we're proud of?** <br/>
The website works well on both laptops tablets. It detects mobile phone users and displays alert message!

5. **Future work?** <br/>
Create feature that allows multiple users using the same whiteboard with Firebase. <br/>
Create a save option so that the note can be uploaded. <br/>
Work on different option of pen (i.e highlighter, thicknessâ€¦ ) <br/> 
Create feature to import images. <br/>
